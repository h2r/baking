Directions
	.	Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Scrub sweet potatoes thoroughly and prick with a fork. Bake for 40 to 60 minutes or until tender.
	.	Meanwhile, for browned butter, melt butter over medium-low heat in a large saucepan. Cook, swirling pan occasionally, for 10 to 12 minutes or until lightly browned and fragrant. Remove pan from heat.
	.	Carefully halve potatoes and scoop out pulp. Mash to desired consistency in a large mixing bowl. Stir mashed potatoes, canned pears and sage into the browned butter in saucepan. Cook and stir until heated through. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
