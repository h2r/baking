Ingredients
1 1/2 pounds ground lamb
2 cloves garlic, finely minced
1/2 pound feta cheese, crumbled
1/2 teaspoon ground allspice
1/3 cup fresh parsley leaves, coarsely chopped
Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper
Easy Tzatziki, recipe follows

Easy Tzatziki:
1 cup Greek whole milk yogurt
1 English cucumber, seeded, finely grated and drained
2 cloves garlic, finely minced
1 teaspoon lemon zest plus 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
2 tablespoons chopped fresh dill
Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper
Directions
In a medium bowl, combine the lamb, garlic, feta, allspice, parsley, salt and pepper, making sure 
not to overwork the mixture. Form the lamb mixture into 4 to 6 patties.

Heat a grill pan over moderately-high heat and cook the lamb burgers until a nice crust forms, about
 4 minutes. Turn the burgers over and let cook another 4 minutes. Let the burgers rest 10 minutes. 
 Serve topped with Easy Tzatziki on a roll or bun.

Easy Tzatziki:
In a medium bowl, whisk together the yogurt, cucumber, garlic, lemon zest, lemon juice and dill. 
Season with salt and pepper. Chill.

What Really Makes This Recipe Sing: Allspice is one of those secret weapons in savory foods. 
You can't put your finger on it, but you know it is there. It was named by the English, because 
they thought it contained cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves. Shh, it is also the secret ingredient in 
Cincinnati-style chili.

What to toss in if you have it: Feel free to add some chopped fresh mint to this as well. Having a 
cocktail party? BYOC and makes these into mini's. Grab one before you serve because they will 
disappear fast.
